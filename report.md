# What i learn 
It was a very effective way of teaching through small, hands-on activities. This approach helped me practice the concepts that I learned in class as well as on my own.

# Git Experience 
My experience was good, but I am still in the learning phase and trying to understand many things. Of course, a lot of practice is still needed, but overall it was fun and engaging.

# Branching Experience
To be honest, I am still a little skeptical about branching because I am currently learning it and it feels somewhat abstract in theory. What I understand so far is that it creates a collaborative environment where team members can work on the same project in different timelines without interfering with each other. For example, one person can work on the index file while another works on the header, navigation bar, or footer, and once completed, their work can be merged into the main branch.
